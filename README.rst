Installation
============
Download and unzip a version of the game from the `Releases`_.

.. _Releases: https://github.com/mristin/master-igayim-desktop/releases

Running
=======
Run ``master-igayim.exe`` (in the directory where you unzipped the game).

Ideas
=====
* Use **resistance bands** for the extra training.
* Clean the windows with your **legs**.

  Practice your kicks, or swing your leg sidewards to stretch your hip.
* Clean **multiple windows** at the same time. Pro challenge: clean with your legs and hands.
* Do the **squats** while cleaning.
* To motivate your kids, ask them to draw **their own levels**. Scan the drawings and save them in ``media/images/level-*.png``.
* Good exercise for **younger kids**: just let them jump around.
